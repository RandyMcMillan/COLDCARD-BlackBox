# BlackBox
This section will demonstrate the basic setup for your BlackBox enclosure. In this demonstration, the final BlackBox installation was outdoors. Give some forethought as to where you will be installing your BlackBox:

- How far is going to be from a suitable power source?
- How far is going to be from an Ethernet port?
- How will sun exposure be throughout the year?
- Is there adequate room for air flow?
- How close are any neighbors?
- Is it in a flood plane?
- Will it be secure?
- Is it out of plain view from the street?

Everyone will have a unique install situation. In this demonstration, the BlackBox was installed on the North side of a garage so that the majority of the year and for most hours of the day, the box will be in the shade to help reduce heat exposure. A dedicated 240v, 20 amp circuit was ran from a sub panel through the wall of the garage and tied into the BlackBox with water-tight conduit, consult a licensed electrician to help with your install.
