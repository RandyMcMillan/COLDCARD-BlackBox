# Installing the BlackBox
This section will demonstrate how to install a BlackBox; sound treatment and electrical connection are covered here. The intent of the BlackBox enclosure is to allow the user to run their mining ASIC hardware outdoors where the heat and noise could more easily be controlled or dissipated. Excessive heat and noise are common problems users experience when mining bitcoin in the home or working space.

The enclosure is designed with the ASIC raised on a platform above the air intake/discharge with a symmetrical ‘S' shaped air flow path connecting each. This flow path allows snow, rain or dirt to fall out before it enters the ASIC, potentially causing damage. The ASIC itself is the prime mover of the heated air with an added barrier creating a pressure seal between the low pressure intake side and the high pressure discharge. The "tortuous" shape of the air flow path also helps deaden the sound waves as it reflects and is absorbed within the enclosure, reducing overall noise. The supporting column holding up the ASIC separates the ‘hot'/'cold' aisles and includes an air recirculating valve (air register) which gives the user the ability to recirculate heat when needed, for example in cold or humid climates. Finally, the design also allows for power scalability by elongating the dimension of the box perpendicular to the air flow path, enabling room for more mining ASICs up to 12 in a row in an 8' long enclosure.

The BlackBox weighs approximately 110 lbs, be sure to have another person help you move it. The dimensions are X"H x X"W x X"D.

Double check that everything looks good once you unpack your BlackBox, checking for dents or scratches, making sure the latches and hinges work, and the filters are in good shape and the bolt-action locks don't bind up.

Inside the BlackBox, you'll find a few included "thank you" items from Upstream Data.

## Sound Treatment
In this demonstration there was not any sound-treatment material included. The final production BlackBoxes will have a sound-treatment liner included. The process of adding sound-treatment material will be covered just in case you are interested in adding additional material above and beyond what is included from the manufacturer. 

One important piece that you will need to manage making on your own is the pressure-barrier. The pressure-barrier will separate the cool side from the hot side, with only the ASIC passing through the barrier. This is how the hot air is forced out through the path of least resistance which is the exhaust port. Without a tight fitting pressure-barrier, then the hot exhaust air from the miner will be circulated back to the intake side of the ASIC where is needs to have cool air coming in. This will cause the miner to over-heat and have problems running smoothly. In this example, a [1" think foam insulation board](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Project-Panels-FOAMULAR-1-in-x-2-ft-x-2-ft-R-5-Small-Projects-Rigid-Pink-Foam-Board-Insulation-Sheathing-PP1/203553730) was used. The advantage of this material is that is creates a good heat transfer barrier, it is cheap, it is easy to work with as it can be cut to any shape with a razor blade. 

For this demonstration some testing was carried out to check the sound levels. You'll notice that the pressure barrier in these photos is cut to the profile of the miner to fit tight against it.

Just checking the ambient noise floor of the garage without the miner running, was ~33dB. With the miner running and the lid open, the noise level was ~82dB. With the miner running and the lid closed, the noise level was ~60dB. ~22dB reduction with no sound treatment is very good in terms of noise attenuation, humans precieve a 10dB attenuation in a noise source as being half as loud, a 20dB attenuation is preceived as a quarter as loud.

The heat coming from the exhaust port was ~130° F.

The first material used in this demonstration was carpet padding. Something similar to [this product](https://www.homedepot.com/p/FUTURE-FOAM-Contractor-1-2-in-Thick-5-lb-Density-Carpet-Cushion-150553557-34/203347540). The profile of the air path way inside the BlackBox was cut out from a piece of the carpet padding so that it could fit on two of the inside walls.

</p>

Then additional pieces were cut out and wrapped around the "T" section in the middle and also applied to the other two remaining walls. Carpet padding was also added to the lower sections. You'll notice in this photo that there is a vent register in the "T" section in the middle. This is how you can choose to allow hot air to circulate back to the intake side to help with intake air that is too humid and or cold.

Then the miner and pressure barrier were put back in place. The carpet padding got the noise level down an additional ~5dB.

In an effort to get the noise level down even further, a sound board material was used to add an additional layer on top of the carpet padding. After some time, the duct tape was no longer doing a good job holding down the carpet padding on the exhaust side.

The basic idea was to just cover the surfaces on the four walls in the upper section of the BlackBox. Two pieces were cut out to fit over the top of the "T" section.

This particular sound board material is flamible. Just for good measure, a layer of foil tape was applied to the sections of board that would be in the hot exhaust path. The foil tape was also used to help secure the four panels against the wall.

Then the miner was placed back in the box, the pressure barrier was trimmed down to account for the added material on the sides of the box, and the sound levels were measured again, there was another ~5dB attenuation.
