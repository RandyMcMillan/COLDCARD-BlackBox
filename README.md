# COLDCARD & BlackBox
A guide for Bitcoin home miners on handling their rewards in a private and air-gapped manner. Mining Bitcoin goes hand in hand with self-custody, the mining pool pays the miner and the miner has to provide a Bitcoin address in order to receive the payouts. This guide aims to demonstrate a few tools that can be used to handle the mining rewards in a way that helps maintain the anonymity gained from mining and sees that through to cold storage.
