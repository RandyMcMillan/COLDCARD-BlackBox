# COLDCARD & BlackBox
A guide for Bitcoin home miners on setting up their BlackBox and handling their mining rewards in a privacy-preserving manner before going to cold storage. Mining Bitcoin goes hand in hand with self-custody, the mining pool pays the miner and the miner provides a Bitcoin address in order to receive the payouts. This guide aims to demonstrate setting up a new BlackBox install and a few tools that can be used to handle the mining rewards in a way that helps maintain the anonymity gained from mining and sees that through to cold storage.
